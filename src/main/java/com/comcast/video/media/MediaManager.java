     * <pre>
     *   1. The list of assets SHALL only contain base ASCII characters
     *   2. Each asset SHALL be separated by a single newline
     *   3. Each field within an asset shall be separated by a single pipe "|" character
     *   4. The fields of a movie will appear in the following order:
     *      1) Title
     *      2) Description
     *      3) Actors (comma delimited list)
     *      4) Year
     *      5) Rating
     *      6) Media
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>In addition each of the special characters may be escaped and used as part of the field
     * instead of a delimiter if it is immediately preceded with a forward slash (<code>\</code>).
     * For example, explicit newlines within a movie's description will appear as the string <code>
     * "\n"</code> and the movie entitled <code>"Escape | A Made Up Movie"</code> would appear as
     * <code>"Escape \| A Made Up Movie"</code>.</p>
