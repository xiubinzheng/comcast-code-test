# Movie Collection

This directory contains a Java project that makes up the entirety of this interview problem.

## Building the Project

By default, this project is controlled as a Maven project.

Although it is not actually required to install Maven to complete this project, it may prove helpful since the configuration will all be done for you. If you wish to download Maven, the link is below.

https://maven.apache.org/

To build your project using Maven, execute the following command from this directory:

```
mvn clean package
```

## Requirements

The goal of this project is to write your own implementation of the following interfaces:

```java
com.comcast.video.media.MediaManager
com.comcast.video.movie.Movie
```

Your interviewer will be interested in not only the functionality of your code but also in your ability to form clear and concise thought patterns throughout your code. In other words, if there is a block of code that you do not think is self explanatory, you should definitely add comments.

Your implementation will operate as the basis for the technical discussions in later phases of the interview process.

Please include all test code you used to verify your implementation when submitting your solution.

Please feel free to modify the included source code to improve code quality.

The implementation of this should take somewhere between 2-3 hours. When you are finished with your implementation, create a zip file that contains this entire directory. When you send it to your interviewer (or Human Resources contact), please indicate the fully qualified name of the class that you wrote that implements `MediaManager`.

Good luck and enjoy. We look forward to seeing your solution!
